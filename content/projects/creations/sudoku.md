Well, I'm not a good Sudoku player, generally hesitate to solve a sudoku. Also it's quite time consuming. One day i came to know about Artificial Intelligence and how it can be used to replicate humans work. I got very facinated by the fact that i can teach my machine to solve a sudoku that can solve quite faster and efficiently than even i could do. Exploring my excitement, I build this OpenCV Sudoku Solver that takes picture of a sudoku as an input and displays a solved sudoku within a minute
