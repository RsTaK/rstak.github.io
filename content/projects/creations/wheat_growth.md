Picture-based insurance (PBI) improves crop insurance for small scale farmers around the world, where images from a smartphone camera keep a record of a cropâ€™s growth and record any damage events that will affect insurance payouts. PBI is a great way for insurers to verify events and to monitor crop growth, but it can also generate overwhelming amounts of data once images stream in from thousands of farmers.

Here, We will automate one part of the data processing pipeline:

* Estimating the growth stage (from scale of 1 - 7) of a wheat crop based on an image sent in by the farmer.

* The images are automatically cropped to show a section of the field
