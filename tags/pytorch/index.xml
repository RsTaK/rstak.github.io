      <description>Leveraging the power of Deep-learning, deployed a Flask based Web application successfully capable of identifying the type of pulse with 98% accuracy on validation dataset.
Currently supports 14 commonly used Pulses in Indian households, namely :
 Adzuki Beans Black Gram Chickpeas Dew Bean Green Chickpeas Green Gram Pinto Beans Red Kidney Beans Red Lentils Split &amp;amp; Skinned Black Gram Split Black Gram Split Green Gram White Kidney Beans Yellow Lentils  Refer to pulse_list.</description>

      <description>Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It&amp;rsquo;s also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection potentially aided by data science can make treatment more effective.</description>
