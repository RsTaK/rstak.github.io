      <description>Picture-based insurance (PBI) improves crop insurance for small scale farmers around the world, where images from a smartphone camera keep a record of a crop’s growth and record any damage events that will affect insurance payouts. PBI is a great way for insurers to verify events and to monitor crop growth, but it can also generate overwhelming amounts of data once images stream in from thousands of farmers.
Here, We will automate one part of the data processing pipeline:</description>

      <description>Dataset provided by Mr. Rohan Rao and Mr. Sanyam Bhutani in form of a Kaggle Competition celebrating its 1-year anniversary.
Wraping up 1st Positon and 3rd Position in StoryTelling and Overall Competition respectively, this analysis with the help of visualizing tools like Bokeh and Plotly not only harness the power of an anecdote but identifies certain patterns in the data, answering some constructive questions like :
 How to get More Audience?</description>

      <guid>https://rstak.github.io/projects/creations/indian_pulses/</guid>
      <description>Leveraging the power of Deep-learning, deployed a Flask based Web application successfully capable of identifying the type of pulse with 98% accuracy on validation dataset.
Currently supports 14 commonly used Pulses in Indian households, namely :
 Adzuki Beans Black Gram Chickpeas Dew Bean Green Chickpeas Green Gram Pinto Beans Red Kidney Beans Red Lentils Split &amp;amp; Skinned Black Gram Split Black Gram Split Green Gram White Kidney Beans Yellow Lentils  Refer to pulse_list.</description>

      <description>Skin cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer. Melanoma, specifically, is responsible for 75% of skin cancer deaths, despite being the least common skin cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It&amp;rsquo;s also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection potentially aided by data science can make treatment more effective.</description>

      <description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;m not a good Sudoku player, generally hesitate to solve a sudoku. Also it&amp;rsquo;s quite time consuming. One day i came to know about Artificial Intelligence and how it can be used to replicate humans work. I got very facinated by the fact that i can teach my machine to solve a sudoku that can solve quite faster and efficiently than even i could do. Exploring my excitement, I build this OpenCV Sudoku Solver that takes picture of a sudoku as an input and displays a solved sudoku within a minute</description>
